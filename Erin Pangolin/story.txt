Erin the Pangolin

Erin was different soul within the world of Pangolin souls. She always knew that
there was something special about her. All her friends and family where eating
the whole day and the only thing they talked about was Black ants, Red ants,
Yellow Meadow ants and and and. Only Laura, her sister, was also somewhat
different, she loved to steal food from from this smelly, sweating, shouting,
ape-like animals. One day Laura told her, that the ape-likes would like to take
her to a Zoo, and that was it. Erin felt alone and looking for an adventure no
Pangolin ever did. She wanted to reach the highest speed a Pangolin ever did.
Some Himalayan peaks around her seemed like a good opportunity. Walking slowly
up, then running as fast as possible, and while running, shaping herself into
her ball stance and .... woooooooooooosh rolling down the cliffs, hills, and
ridges. She knew exactly how high the peaks, surrounding her, were, Frederic her
grand-pa told her. But the important question was: Between which peak would she
reach the fastest speed? It quite likely would be the peak where there was the
biggest steepness. Which mountain would this be?

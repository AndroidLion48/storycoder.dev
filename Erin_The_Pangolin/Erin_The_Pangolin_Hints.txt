Assumptions:
• The pangolin only goes forward,
• one peak after the other,
• the list of peaks is ordered,
• the pangolin only rolles downward (as he cannot fly)

Make an array of all the peaks
Set a variable of the maximal peak index to 0
Set a variable of the maximal difference to 0
Make a for loop, calculating only the positive difference between one item in the array and the adjacent item
Set two new conditions in the loop by setting the maximal peak index to i  and the maximal difference to (peaks i) - (peaks i+1)
Print maximal peak index, maximal difference, maximal difference + 1

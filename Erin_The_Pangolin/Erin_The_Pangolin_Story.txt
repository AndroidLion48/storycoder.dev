Erin the Pangolin

Erin was different soul within the world of Pangolin souls. She always knew that
there was something special about her. All her friends and family where eating
the whole day and the only thing they talked about was Black ants, Red ants,
Yellow Meadow ants and and and. Only Laura, her sister, was also somewhat
different, she loved to steal food from this smelly, sweating, shouting,
ape-like animals. One day Laura told her, that the ape-likes would like to take
her to a Zoo, and that was it. For Erin, this was not enough and started to
think about an adventure, no Pangolin ever did. She wanted to reach the highest
speed a Pangolin ever did. Some Himalayan peaks around her seemed like a good
opportunity. Walking slowly up, then running as fast as possible, and while
running, shaping herself into her ball stance and .... woooooooooooosh rolling
down the cliffs, hills, and ridges. She knew exactly how high the peaks,
surrounding her, were, Frederic her grand-pa told her: 1335, 1439, 987, 312,
871, 1461, 1171, 654 and 123 meters high. But the important question was:
Between which peak would she reach the fastest speed? It quite likely would be
the peak where there was the biggest steepness. Which mountain would this be?

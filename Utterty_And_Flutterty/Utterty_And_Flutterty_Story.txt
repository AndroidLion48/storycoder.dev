Utterty and Flutterty 🦋♥️🦋 

On a perfect summer evening, flying around as if love never ends, dreaming beyond as if love never sleeps 
and fluttering around as if love never lands, there is Butterfly Utterty 🦋. Being so in love and nervous 💘, 
he nearly forgets to put on his newly purchased rose-tinted glasses 🤓 to go out today . 
He’s having so many butterflies in his stomach, even though he is a butterfly himself 😂😂😂. 
Of course some wonder, if that’s even possible 🧐😂. He’s flying around and from far far away, in his rose-coloured sky, 
there comes flying Butterfly Flutterty 🦋. He of course asks her for a date ♥️ to play dart 🎯 together. 
Flutterty, however, agrees only upon certain conditions: If Utterty can list the first four lines 
of her most favourite Shakespeare sonnet ever, which is sonnet 116, with only listing every second letter in less than 30 sec; 
Flutterty will meet on Monday already; if he takes more than 30 sec she will meet on Tuesday, 
if he lists the lines with every letter instead of every second letter she will meet on Wednesday; 
otherwise she’s not interested in dating Utterty 🥲! Utterty of course is flabbergasted, 
but quickly thinks of all possible outcomes. Print all of them.

Shakespeare, Sonnet 116
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.

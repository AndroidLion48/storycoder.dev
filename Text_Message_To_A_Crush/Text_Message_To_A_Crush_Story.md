# Text Message to a Crush

Thumbs feverishly hit the phone screen 📱. The sentence on screen reads 👓: “I’d
love to meet you tonight 🌃 but right now is.” You stop 🛑 ... Deleting the text
in the message composer. You look up and ask whether this is the right message
💌 to send to your new crush 💕. Your friend shrugs his shoulders and says, "I
don’t know.. 🤔" and the laughter of the night pushes you away 😃. You walk
outside, look at the moon 🌛, and breathe in and out. You think, "Let’s do
this!"

Cruel Teacher

On a beautiful Friday morning the teacher happily gets her daily latte, the sun shines through her witch like gray hair, 
and she carries her beloved morning news 📰 paper called ‘cruel teaching methods’. Happy 😊 she is, because today is exam day, 
where she soothingly sits in the old wooden chair, sipping coffee ☕️ and reading in an undisturbed way while students 
sweat through her unconquerable exam. To make sure her morning passes as quietly as planned for her, she enforces strict methods. 
With herfavorite number being 7, with every passing minute that students come late to her computer science exam, 
they have to increasingly pay a penalty of $7. Ten of her students are late while dropping in one minute after the other minute 
right after the regular start. The teacher is furious, her hair stands up, with her beloved coffee time beeing constantly interrupted. 
However, she takes comfort in earning money! Print how much money she will have earned in the end!

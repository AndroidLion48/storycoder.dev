Winter Calmness â€“ Summer Madness

This quietness undeniably evokes this moment of profound calmness within, 
but at the same time it fosters this sheer solitude, which seems irrevocably unbearable at times. 
Walking down this dark alley, this abandoned alley, with only imagined sunshine, 
brings pensiveness to the point as to which doubts arose whether going on this journey alone, 
in the dawn of a deep winter night, was the right decision. The masses of snow, 
covering all man-made architecture and urbanity, promote this feeling of silence 
as the snow cushions the otherwise prevailing loudness of old buses, car engines and fellow people. 
From the bench, looking at the street, the feeling of this winter beauty is everything. 

It is everything compared to when I think of the summer, when I ponder how many people pass this daring street 
with loudness, with no calmness to think. In the summer every three minutes a bus drives past, 
at noon passing with two passengers, and then carrying literally a dozen people more with every passing quarter of an hour. 
Worse are only the cars, almost only driving with one driver and empty seats, 
except at every 6th minute where a full car carrying five people passes. 
The walkers are the least loudest, because in a time span of eleven minutes, a soothing rhythm is observed, 
at which with every passing minute one more walker passes until the eleventh minute, at which the cycle restarts. 
A deep feeling of uneasiness awakens amid the calmness, thinking of how many people pass this street 
from noon to 6 pm on a noisy summer day? Print the result. From the bench, looking at the street, 
the feeling of this summer madness is everything. (LillyCode, creative commons license CC BY-NC-SA)

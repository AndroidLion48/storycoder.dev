Antheias Garden

Antheia was walking through a colorful garden and somehow had an odd feeling
that there is something missing. There was a tree ðŸŒ³, many stones ðŸª¨, even some
lizards ðŸ¦Ž which already found their way into this odoriferous spot.

A pond ðŸŒŠ! Antheia was powerful enough to wish a tiny pond into existence.
Minutes later, some rainbow trouts already found a new home.

But now waiting until water lilies are fully grown? Not really necessary, as
every day the water lilies double themselves anyway.

There was just a full-moon ðŸŒ• and Antheia could get back when the moon fully
shines again. For today Antheia just puts one beautiful water lily into the pond.

How many water lilies will Antheia see when she returns on the next full-moon
ðŸŒ•?

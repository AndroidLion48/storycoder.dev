Poseidons Ice Cubes 🧊🧊🧊⚓️🧜‍♂️

It’s boat day today with beautiful weather at the sea, 
and all is packed to seize the day to the fullest, to ‘carpe diem’, 
just as famous Roman poet Horace had suggested to do everyday. 
However, for some reason, the mighty water God Poseidon has not enjoyed 
his drinks last night as much as he usually does; and threw a lot of spare 
ice cubes from the drinks into the sea! Thus, the water got extensively colder; 
to be more specific it is 11.475 Seidons cold now, which is 14 Seidons colder 
than normally. Thus today swimming is not allowed. Seidon is the temperature 
entity of the sea. 1 Seidon devided by 1.37 equal 1 Degree Celsius. 
Print the water temperature in both entities with max two fraction digit 
with an equation on a normal, ice-cube free day!

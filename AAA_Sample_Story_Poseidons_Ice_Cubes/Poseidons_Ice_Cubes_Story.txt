Poseidons Ice Cubes 🧊🧊🧊⚓️🧜‍♂️

It’s boat day today ⛵ with beautiful weather at the sea 🌅 , 
and all is packed to seize the day to the fullest, to ‘carpe diem’ 😃, 
just as famous Roman poet Horace had suggested to do everyday . 
However, for some reason, the mighty water God Poseidon 🔱🧜‍♂ has not enjoyed 
his drinks 🍹 last night as much as he usually does; and threw a lot of spare 
ice cubes from the drinks into the sea 🌊! Thus, the water got extensively colder 🥶; 
to be more specific it is 11.475 Seidons cold now, which is 14 Seidons colder 
than normally. Thus today swimming is not allowed. Seidon is the temperature 
unit of the sea. 1 Seidon devided by 1.37 equals 1 Degree Celsius. 
Print the water temperature 🌡️ in both entities with max two fraction digit 
with an equation on a normal, ice-cube free day! (LillyCode, creative commons license CC BY-NC-SA)

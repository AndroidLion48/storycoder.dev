Utterly and Flutterly 🦋♥️🦋

On a perfect summer evening, flying around as if love never ends, dreaming beyond as if love never sleeps and fluttering around as if love never lands, there is Butterfly Utterly 🦋. Being so in love and nervous 💘, he nearly forgets to put on his newly purchased rose-tinted glasses 🤓 to go out today . He’s having so many butterflies in his stomach, even though he is a butterfly himself 😂😂😂. Of course some wonder, if that’s even possible 🧐😂. He’s flying around and from far far away, in his rose-coloured sky, there comes flying Butterfly Flutterly 🦋. He of course asks her for a date ♥️ to play dart 🎯 together. Flutterly, however, agrees only upon certain conditions: If Utterly can list the first four lines of her most favourite Shakespeare’s sonnet ever, which is sonnet 116, with only listing every second letter in less than 30 sec; Flutterly will meet on Monday already; if he takes more than 30 sec she will meet on Tuesday, if he lists the lines with every letter instead of every second letter she will meet on Wednesday; otherwise she’s not interested in dating Utterly 🥹🥲! Utterly of course is flabbergasted, but quickly thinks of all possible outcomes. Print all of them. (LillyCode, creative commons license CC BY-NC-SA) 

Shakespeare, Sonnet 116
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.

## Sharing is Caring
This story is dedicated to the famous Christmas hacking taking place during advent.

Scene: Santa and the elves Cody, Louisa, Sleepy, Noisy, Buildy, Calcy, Singy, Sneaky and Drinky

And Santa excitingly, but also slightly stressed, looks at his overly punctual, never late watch and shouts: 
“Elves, let’s move it, move it, the rucksacks are finally on board, we need to depart!”

The elves happily, but also utterly exhausted, take their cushioned Christmassly decorated seats in Santa’s overloaded sleigh! 
Coloured presents, fir tree branches, reindeer equipments, cookies, open milk jugs, and a lot of personal traveling items are on board of this sleigh 
(yes, almost unbelievable, but some elves heavily exaggerated on the allowed amount of personal baggage. 
But Santa was courageously relaxed about this, as he knows in the end that some elves, mostly always the same ones, 
exceed the allowed baggage limit also when they travel on planes!

“Yeyy”, said Noisy, “we’re going on a road trip”, while heartily listening to Christmas carols on his inherited old school disc man! 
Excitement arises, and the elves’ hearts start beating faster, except for the really tired elves, they’re bound to fall asleep, 
among them is Sleepy. Louisa, also known as the bookworm elf, deepens into her late grandma’s favorite Christmas story book. Cody, however, 
is doing the 5th day of Christmas hacking today on his new (N-1)1 computer, as he somehow found a way to get the challenge a day prior. 
Buildy, on the other hand, is building a wooden mini sleigh, whereas Singy is singing, Calcy is doing math and Drinky is drinking cinnamon latte.

And then there is Sneaky, who, because everyone else is doing something, decides, out of sneakishness, to take away food from Louisa’s bag. 
Noisy sees this, thinks to himself: “How unfair is that, so typical of Sneaky”; but then decides to also take food from other elves’ bags as well. 
And the sneakishness among the elves continues. Santa isn’t so happy about that and thus wants to know two things: 

# Questions: 
Print
1) The highest amount of food type that each elf carries in the end. (One food type per elf: The highest amount of food type per elf). 
Round the amounts of food types to full numbers.
2) The total amount of all food types per elf in the end. And who has the highest amount of total food types and wins?
 
Santa, together with his elves, decides that after coding this, they would put all their foods on the table share. And the moral of the story is: Sharing is caring!

# Take a Guess. Non-Codable Questions:
1) The story contains many (pop) cultural references to books, music, tech, etc.; what are they?

Front of the sleigh

At the beginning each elf has 100 pieces of each food. 
- Every elf having a neighbour to the right takes 2 cookies each from that neighbour, and 1/6 of the combined amount of stolen cookies gets eaten. 
- Every elf having a neighbour to the left takes 5 caramel bonbons each from that neighbour, and 1/3 of the combined amount stolen of bonbons gets eaten. 
- Every elf in the middle that has neighbours left and right, takes from them each 3 chocolate Christmas trees, and none get eaten.
- Every elf having an elf sitting behind them, takes 6 chewing gums each from that elf, and 1/4 of the combined stolen amount of cheewing gum gets eaten. 
- Every elf having an elf sitting in from of them, takes 7 candies each from that elf, and 1/2 of the combined stolen amount of candies get eaten. 
- Every elf having an elf sitting in front and in the back of them, takes 8 ginger breads from that elf, and 2/5 of the combined stolen amount of ginger breads get eaten.

After a copious candy and sweets eating feast, all the elves and Santa fall contentedly asleep, as the reindeers continue the journey in the darkness of a Dezember night.
